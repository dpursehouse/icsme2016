When multiple changes need to be created or updated for a single push
operation they are now inserted into the database by parallel threads,
up to the maximum allowed thread count. The current thread is used
when the thread pool is already fully in use, falling back to the
prior behavior where each concurrent push operation can do its own
concurrent database update. The thread pool exists to reduce latency
so long as there are sufficient threads available.

This helps push times on databases that are high latency, such as
database servers that are running on a different machine from the
Gerrit server itself, e.g. gerrit.googlesource.com.

The new thread pool is disabled by default, limiting the overhead to
servers that have good latency with their database, such as using
in-process H2 database, or a MySQL or PostgreSQL on the same host.

A long standing bug in SSHD Mina where packets gets out of
order during the rekey phase, will force the ControlMaster
to disconnect during high load (repo -jxx):

  Protocol error: expected packet type 31, got 94

This fix allows us to change the trigger limits for rekeying:

  rekeyTimeLimit - Default value 1h
  rekeyBytesLimit - Default value 1073741824 (bytes, 1GB)

The rekeyTimeLimit can be set to 0 to disable the trigger.

The rekeyBytesLimit can never be set to lower than 32, (Mina
will automatically raise the value to 32 if lower).

To get rid of the Protocol error by using these configuration
values, you can set rekeyTimeLimit to 0 (disables it) and also
set a very high rekeyBytesLimit. This will ensure that the bug
prone rekeying logic in SSHD Mina will never be executed.

Openssh client sends two requests, one without a key signature to verify

after having loaded the private key and signed some data for actual

To prevent that the PublickeyAuthenticator#authenticate is called twice
cache the authentication status for session and public key.  Implement
SessionListener to clean up the cache entry when session is destroyed.

scrollbars are rendered in the Codemirror at the bottom of the

we would likely have to steal the scroll bars inside Codemirror

c31e17f Update sshd to 0.11.0
b9c66ea Bump SSHD version to 0.10.1 and enable nio2 backend

The reason for the downgrade (copied from the change 60161):

SSHD release 0.9 is known to be free from exhausting thread pool problem
[1]. Unfortunately 0.9 release suffers from sporadic handshake failures
[2].  The fix cannot be cleanly cherry-picked to 0.9 release. The back
port of this fix [3] is tracked under its own issue [4], was uploaded as
PR for SSHD Mina's GH repository [5] and merged recently [6].

Moreover, 0.9 suffers from ""Authenticated with partial success"" issue
[7]
that was fixed by [8], [9]; this patch must be applied as well.

This reverts commit d5bbe0841fb3b6ec2ca7dd7f28bb9bccb857c9c1.

Labels are returned to the browser inside of a map/object
whose ordering is undefined once parsed into a JavaScript
object for use by the UI.

By removing client side sorting we are at the mercy of
the browser's iteration of map/object keys, which can be
different across versions or implementations.

A correct solution to rely on project defined ordering
will require exporting the project defined ordering in
the label data, or as part of the project config read
for the change. But just dropping client side sorting is
not a solution.

SSHD was downgraded to 0.9.0 (plus selected bug fixes) on the
stable-2.9 branch and will be merged up to master soon.

ECDSA is not supported in that SSHD version, so it must be
reverted.

This reverts commit f7569d0cb27df67728b4c717ba5e4ac2bb4b7080.
The implementation removes any ability for slow GroupBackends
to perform their own per-request group level caching.

The correct way to do less eager lookups is for the LDAP
implementation of GroupBackend to create an emtpy membership
and then populate it on demand as requests arrive and need
to be looked up in the contains() methods.

",others,gerrit,others,2015/02/12 14:24:34,"Perform user.getEffectiveGroups() less eagerly

Most of the time we used the following pattern to check if a user is
a member of one of the given groups:

  user.getEffectiveGroups().containsAnyOf(groups)

The getEffectiveGroups used to eagerly fetch all groups where this user
belongs to from all registered group backends. This included also
recursive expansion of all LDAP groups this user is a member of. Even
if the set of given groups was consisting of only local Gerrit groups
the code above would still first fetch from all known group backends.
This was particularly bad when using LDAP for user authentication but
not using the LDAP groups otherwise. In large corporate setups a user
could be a member of hundreds of LDAP groups which would all
unnecessarily be fetched just to verify if the user is a member of a
local group.

Introduce the:

  GroupBacked.memberOfAny(user, groups)

to enable a more lazy implementation. The UniversalGroupBackend will
first partition the groups based on their group backends and then only
fetch groups from the involved backends. For an LDAP based Gerrit
instance which doesn't make use of LDAP groups this would effectively
avoid fetching of the LDAP groups for this user.

In our corporate setup this reduces the data transfered between the LDAP
server and a Gerrit instance from 250KB down to 6KB, per user.
